                    <h3>Why is it important to celebrate our differences?</h3>
                    <p>Write the Big Question on chart paper and tell students they will explore this question as they read <i>Just Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, Be You.</i>  </p>
                   <p>To spark ideas, ask students to think about interesting qualities, interests, or abilities that describe themselves and write three ideas on sticky notes. Prompt students by sharing some thoughts of your own, such as “I am left-handed,” “I like riding my bike,” or “I can speak two languages.”</p>
                   <p>Have students work with partners to compare and contrast their ideas. Pairs can place their sticky notes in a Venn diagram such as the one below to show how they are different from each other and how they are alike. If partners do not find something they have in common, have them discuss their qualities, skills, and interests until they uncover some ways in which they are similar to add to their diagram. </p>
                   <p>[SPEC: Create a Venn diagram of overlapping ovals, as shown above. Left oval should have a head “Partner 1”; the far right oval should have a head “Partner 2” In the middle/overlapping section, please show the borders of both ovals to create a text field. Inside, show head “Both”. Place the bulleted text as shown above in each section of the diagram.]</p>
                   <p>Then have partners share their diagrams and ideas with the whole class. Use sentence frames such as the ones below to support discussion:</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>Something I have in common with my partner is <span class="longl">________</span> .</li>
                        <li>One way that I am unique is <span class="longl">________</span> .</li>
                        <li>One way my partner is unique is <span class="longl">________</span> .</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Tell students to keep these ideas in mind as they explore the Big Question throughout the lesson.</p>

                    <p>Explain that in the story, students will meet several characters who have both similarities and differences. Review some of the examples of differences that student pairs listed in their Venn diagrams. Then have partners discuss how people’s unique qualities—how we are different—can make the world a more interesting and fun place to live in. Prompt them with sentences frames such as the following:</p>
                    
                        <p>No two people are exactly the same because <span class="longl">________</span> . </p>
                        <p>If everyone were the same, <span class="longl">________</span> .</p>
                        <p>I think our differences make the world interesting because <span class="longl">________</span> .</p>
                    
                   
                    <h3>Write About It!</h3>
                    <p><span class="bold">Journal</span> After students have discussed in pairs, display the sentence frame below and have students respond in their journals. Explain that students will revisit their responses after they read each part of the story and learn about each character's experience.</p>

                    <p>The book begins with A Letter to the Reader from the author. Justice Sonia Sotomayor explains that as a child with juvenile diabetes, she often felt different because of her medical condition. She notes she wrote the book to explain how differences such as hers make us stronger in a good way, and she encourages readers to “just ask” if they ever wonder why someone is doing something different. After the author’s letter, we meet Sonia, who explains that she and her friends are planting a garden. She notes how kids, like flowers and plants in a garden, are all different, each with a special characteristic and each growing in his or her own way. Sonia explains that she must take insulin to be healthy. Then we meet two other children: Rafael, who has asthma and uses an inhaler to be healthy, and Anthony, a boy who cannot walk and gets around “super fast” in a wheelchair.</p>

                    <p>In this part of the story, the reader meets seven more children. Madison and Arturo are blind and get around with the aid of a guide dog and a cane. They note how they strengthen their other senses to notice things other people may miss. Next comes Vijay, who is deaf. Vijay communicates with sign language and explains that he loves to read and write. Bianca, who has dyslexia, explains her condition, and notes that she’s very good at making art from pictures in her mind. Jordan and Tiana both have autism. Jordan’s autism makes him very good at counting and organizing his toy dinosaurs, which he loves to talk about. Tiana, however, doesn’t talk. Finally, the reader meets Anh, who speaks with a stutter. Anh explains she is a very good listener because listening comes more easily to her than talking. </p>

                           <p>In this online speech, the illustrator Rafael López shares his thoughts about <i>Just Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, Be You</i> and its themes. He mentions his personal connection to the topic—he had to manage his own dyslexia as a child, and his son Santiago has high functioning autism. Set a purpose for viewing by asking students to record two to three interesting things that they notice or wonder about Rafael López as they view the video.</p>
                            <p>Once students have viewed the video, discuss Rafael López’s contribution to the book. Encourage students to refer to their notes during the discussion. </p>

                    <h3>The Illustrator’s Craft</h3>
                   
                    <p>In the second part of the story, Sonia Sotomayor introduces seven more children. The text explains each child’s condition, and Rafael López’s imaginative illustrations play an important part in supporting readers’ understanding of the text. Remind students of the video of Rafael López’s speech. Point out that López says that tough challenges are put in our way not to stop us but to call on our courage to “be all we can be.” </p>
                    <p>Ask students to think of challenges that have required them or someone they know to be brave in order to “be all you can be.” Have students write in their journal explaining the challenge and how courage helped them overcome it. </p>
                    <p>As needed, explain that “be all you can be” means to do your best and use your abilities in the best way possible. </p>
                   
                   <h3>Write About It!</h3>
                    <p><span class="bold">Journal</span> Use the sentence frames below to write about challenges.</p>
                    <p>A challenge <i>/I / someone I know/</i> had was <span class="longl">__________</span> . <span class="longl">__________</span> showed courage to deal with this challenge by <span class="longl">__________</span> . This helped <span class="longl">__________</span>  be all <i>/I / he / she/</i> can be because <span class="longl">__________</span> .</p>
                    <p>If students need more prompting, work together to review the types of challenges that the children in the story have and how they use courage to deal with their challenges. Then discuss examples of other challenges that they or people they know have had and how they used courage to deal with them.Display student exemplars for students to use use as guideposts with their writing.</p>   
                    <p>Student Exemplars:<br/>
                    “A challenge I had was when I broke my arm. I showed courage to deal with this challenge by working hard to make my arm strong again. This helped me be all I can be because I learned that hard work will help me overcome challenges.”</p>
                    <p>“A challenge I had was when I struggled to learn how to speak another language. I showed courage to deal with this challenge by being brave to try to speak even when I made mistakes. This helped me be all I can be because I learned how to learn from my mistakes.”</p>

                    <p>The last section begins with Julia, who has Tourette’s syndrome. Julia explains that she often wiggles and makes sounds, which makes people look at her funny. She feels frustrated at times when she tries to explain her condition to people, but notes that explaining it helps. Manuel has attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and feels frustrated when he has to sit still. It helps him when teachers or friends are patient with him. Next comes Nolan, who is allergic to nuts. He explains he has to be very careful not to eat nuts, and he uses his voice to tell people about his allergy in order to stay safe. Finally, Grace introduces herself. Grace was born with Down syndrome. She explains she can do almost anything other kids can do, although it takes her time to learn new things. The book returns to Sonia, who stands in the completed garden with all her friends. Sonia wonders what their garden would be like if all of the plants were exactly the same. She ends by explaining that each of us—the children in the book and the reader—has unique powers to share, which make the world a more interesting and richer place. </p>

                    <p>The following video is a child’s book report of <i>Just Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, Be You.</i> Share the video with students to get them thinking and talking about the main themes in the book.</p>
                    <p>Before playing the video, have students set a purpose for viewing. Ask them to think about the important ideas in the book and how the girl giving the book report, Jenisha, uses her own words to talk about these ideas.

                    <p>Remind students that the characters in this story might be mirrors (a reflection of their own experiences), windows (a view into another’s experience), or both. Then students consider the unique powers that the children have in <i>Just Ask!</i> Be Different, Be Brave, Be You. Have partners choose one or two of the children to discuss. Prompt them with the following questions:</p>
                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>What is each child’s unique power?</li>
                        <li>How does each child share his or her power with the world?</li>
                        <li>What do you like or admire about these children and the powers they have?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remind students that the book ends with this question: “What will you do with your powers?” Ask students to think about how they would answer this question. Have them identify their unique powers and think about what they might do with those powers.</p>

                    <p>Provide time for student pairs to practice their presentations, reminding students that each partner should have a significant role in presenting their project. Partners should work collaboratively and follow agreed upon rules, norms, and protocols. Review the 4-Point Project Rubric with students so they understand how they will be assessed. </p>

                    <p>Explain that students can strengthen their presentations by incorporating different types of media, such as photographs, drawings, and videos. Model how to present orally.</p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>When I present, I make eye contact with the audience. I don’t keep my eyes down. </li>

                        <li>I pronounce each of my words clearly and correctly.</li>
                        <li>I do not rush through my presentation, but speak clearly and at a natural pace.</li>

                                <p>
                                    Sonia and thirteen friends are planting a beautiful garden. Each child has a physical or medical condition that gives her or him a unique way of participating. The book begins with A Letter to Readers, in which the author, United States Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, explains her message—that our differences make us stronger in a positive way.</p>
                                    <p> After the author’s note, we meet young Sonia, who introduces herself and her own unique condition—juvenile diabetes. Sonia explains that like the many different plants and flowers in a garden, people are all different, too. </p>
                               <p>Sonia then introduces her thirteen friends, each with her or his own unique condition. Along the way, the characters use questions to learn about each other and their special “powers.”  They also learn the importance of being brave enough to “just ask” when curious about things we don’t understand. The story ends with all the children celebrating themselves and the beautiful garden they have created together. </p>
                               <p> <span class="bold">Note:</span> This book does not include page numbers. For this lesson, the first page of the story is page 4, the left-hand page immediately following A Letter to Readers.</p>

                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Theme Overview </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold"> Understanding and Celebrating Our Differences</span> Justice Sonia Sotomayor explains that her purpose for writing <i>Just Ask! Be Different, Be Brave, Be You </i> was to show “how our differences make us stronger in a good way.” Starting with her own childhood diagnosis of diabetes, Justice Sotomayor introduces the reader to thirteen  children, each living  with a medical or physical condition, including diabetes, asthma, blindness, autism, and ADHD. The conditions are described without judgment, and each child is celebrated for the unique strengths, or “powers,” that come from living with her or his condition.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p>Justice Sotomayor uses the extended metaphor of a garden to reinforce the theme of celebrating differences. In the story, Sonia points out that gardens are “magical places” with thousands of different plants growing and blooming together. Each plant has its own unique qualities and requirements to help it grow and thrive—just like the children who help Sonia plant the garden. The metaphor is reinforced by Rafael López’s vibrant illustrations.</p>

                                <p><span class="bold">Bravery in Curiosity</span> Justice Sotomayor sums up another central message in the book with, “If you ever wonder why someone is doing something different from other kids, Just Ask.” The author encourages young readers to speak up when they are curious about another person’s unique situation. Rather than remaining silent and making assumptions, kids should be brave and “just ask” questions. Sonia does point out, however, that people should be thoughtful with this approach, because “Not everyone is comfortable answering questions about themselves.”
                                </p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues </h2>
                                <p><span class="bold">Discussing People with Disabilities</span> Justice Sotomayor carefully avoids the terms “disabled” and “disability,” and instead uses the term “conditions.” As such, be sensitive to your own choice of words when discussing the story. The “differences” that Justice Sotomayor describes are not in relation to a particular idea of “normal”—instead they refer to the ways in which each child, including the reader, is unique and powerful. </p>
                                <p>Please note that some of the conditions may be unfamiliar to students. Consider providing short videos or other resources to build students’ background knowledge. In these discussions, try to mirror the author’s care and sensitivity in presenting the conditions with positive, inclusive language. The following article on language for discussing or writing about people with disabilities provides some guidance on this topic: <a target="_blank" href="https://ncdj.org/style-guide/">Disability Language Guide</a>.</p>

                            <p>This activity asks students to discuss and analyze the animal characters in many of the illustrations throughout the story, starting with the dedication page (page 2). If there are not multiple copies of the text available, project or display the illustration for everyone to see.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">1.</span> Ask students to think about the animals in the illustrations in the book. What did they notice about the animals? What did these details make them wonder about the world of the story?</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">2.</span> Divide students into three groups. Assign a section of the text to each group: pp. 2–11, 12–21, and 21–31.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">3.</span> Have students use these sentence frames to discuss the animals in the illustrations with their group. Students can write down their ideas.<br/>

                            <p><span class="bold">4.</span> Then have the groups come together and discuss all three sections, using the following guiding questions:</p>
                            <ul class="small-bullet">
                                <li>What were the animal characters in each part of the book? What were they doing? <i>(a rabbit; dragonflies, butterflies, a cricket, and other insects; birds, including an owl; a dog; and a squirrel. The owl was winking at Julia; the squirrel was offering Nolan a nut. The other animals were watching the kids.)</i> </li>
                                <li>How did the children in the book interact with some of the animals? <i>(Example: Sonia stares at the rabbit. Julia winks back at the owl. It is as if the animals understand and appreciate the children and their garden.)</i></li>
                                <li>Why do you think the illustrator added the animal characters, since they are not mentioned in the text? <i>(Sample answer: The animals are like quiet friends who appreciate the children, whatever the children’s differences are.)</i></li>
                                <li>What do the animal characters show you about appreciating and celebrating people with differences? <i>(The animals accept the children for who they are.)</i></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><span class="bold">5.</span> After discussing, tell each student to write a sentence that tells why they think the illustrator chose to add animal characters in this book.</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">6.</span> Have students share their sentences with their partner or group. Provide the following sentence frames:</p>
                            <p>Rafael López's use of animal characters adds to the story by <span class="longl">______</span> . The animals show <span class="longl">_________</span> about people’s differences.</p>
